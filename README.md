This repo contains many of the data science projects I completed during my college career (August 2022 - May 2025), either in class or for fun.

A commonly used package in my data mining projects is completejourney, which has a robust dataset of a year's worth of grocery transactions, as well as household and promotion information. See more [here](https://github.com/bradleyboehmke/completejourney).
